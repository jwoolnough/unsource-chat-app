# Unsource Chat

Real-time chat application built using Next.js, Firebase and Tailwind for a startup that never came to be.

Demo: [unsource-chat-app.vercel.app](https://unsource-chat-app.vercel.app/)

## Roadmap/Todos

- Edit messages
- Avatar uploads/settings page
- Message reactions
- Notifications via browser Push API
- Properly implement server rendering/`await`ed components with `suspense`
- Diagnose and fix performance issue in Safari - something to do with browser paint and not a React issue
- Polyfill `:has` in Firefox (or wait until Firefox supports it...)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
